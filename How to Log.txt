How to LOG :-

1-Install Universal ADB drivers if you dont have them

2-In your phone Enable USB debugging in developer options (if in a bootloop no need if your kernel has ADB support for example refined kernel)

3-Double click on the needed log type

4-Send the generated .log file

log-all 	= Verbose logcat, basiclly everything
log-error 	= E filter logcat, for Bootloops/App crashes
log-ril 	= Logcat for simcard issues and no signal etc
log-kmsg	= Log for Kernel crashes or stuck at splash screen
log-dmsg	= Log for kernel on an active system


P.S : if you see nothing after adb devices or you see device not found, that means check step 1/2
